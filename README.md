This project was made to solve a problem. For content creators, those who post content on regular basis on platforms like Instagram/LinkedIn have to first spare some time to edit the posts. With the help of this project, such a person will only have to edit few templates for once and that's it. Then just with a click of a button one can download attractive and already edited posts and can easily post them. 


We will be developing an automatic Instagram post maker. With the help of Web scraping, we will scrap data from the internet and dump it on our personal website which we will be creating and convert that text into a downloadable file (JPEG/PNG). On our website, there will be templates already present, and scrapped data will be dumped on that template only.
Flask framework for back-end, Beautiful Soup for scrapping, Html2Canvas.js for conversion, and HTML, CSS for webpage development will be used.
